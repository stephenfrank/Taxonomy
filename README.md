# Taxonomy Module for ExpressionEngine 2.0

### Overview

The Taxonomy Module is a navigation/breadcrumb building tool for 'page' sections of your site.

Taxonomy lets you build navigation trees to unlimited depths which comprise of any of the following types of links:

1. Build links in your tree which use regular template_group/url_title or template_group/template/url_title paths
2. Build links in your tree from entries using page uris from the EE Pages Module
3. Or enter a url override to build nodes in your tree that link to anywhere you like

The module comes bundled with a field-type to allow publishers to insert menu items directly from the publish page.

Taxonomy allows you to create as many trees as you need to handle multiple menus.

### Donations

You can use all my code without paying anything! Having said that, a lot of work has gone into creating this module. If my code saves you some time and trouble, and you feel like making a small donation to support my future development efforts, it would be very much appreciated.
